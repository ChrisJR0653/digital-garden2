Public learning means sharing information, ideas, and knowledge to the public online, rather than keep them private & offline.

So much of the value generated each day never sees the light of day, which slows down the development of the human species.

Learning in Public means creating value & sharing the value in public. There are many different ways you can generate value:

1. articles/newsletters/blogs
2. YouTube videos
3. social media posts

There are also many different ways you can _boost_ the value of others by learning in public:

1. sharing articles/posts/videos to your own network
2. commenting with questions & insights on the work of others, stimulating public conversation
3. curating the work of others into compilations of value

You don't have to be a "creator" to share or boost value. Participating in the public discourse adds a ton of value. It's a form of [Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-supported_collaborative_learning)

The reason we should never stop learning is bourn out by [[Digital Garden/What is "The Nun Study"?\|What is "The Nun Study"?]]

The Nun Study
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9127971/

The Nun Study is ==a longitudinal study of aging and Alzheimer's disease that examines the brains of Catholic sisters==. The study's findings have helped scientists better understand how Alzheimer's disease and other factors affect the brain and cognitive function. 

What the study found

- **Brain pathology**
		
		The study found that a combination of Alzheimer's disease and brain infarcts (strokes) is strongly associated with dementia. 
		
- **Early cognitive status**
		
		The study found that cognitive limitations in early life can predict the development of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia later in life. 
		
- **Exercise**
		
		The study found that exercise can help people retain cognitive abilities as they age. 
		
- **Antioxidants**
		
		The study suggests that antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, may help protect the brain from oxidative stress, which can contribute to Alzheimer's disease. 
		

How the study was conducted 

- The study collected data on the sisters' risk factors in early and middle life.
- The sisters underwent annual cognitive and physical function evaluations as they aged.
- After death, the sisters' brains were examined for signs of Alzheimer's disease and other brain pathology.

Why the study is important

- The Nun Study is unique because it includes a large number of brains from people who did not have dementia. 
- The study's findings can help scientists develop new ways to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease.
