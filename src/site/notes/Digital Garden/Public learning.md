Public learning means sharing information, ideas, and knowledge to the public online, rather than keep them private & offline.

So much of the value generated each day never sees the light of day, which slows down the development of the human species.

Learning in Public means creating value & sharing the value in public. There are many different ways you can generate value:

1. articles/newsletters/blogs
2. YouTube videos
3. social media posts - see [[Digital Garden/Algorithmic Attention\|Algorithmic Attention]]

There are also many different ways you can _boost_ the value of others by learning in public:

1. sharing articles/posts/videos to your own network
2. commenting with questions & insights on the work of others, stimulating public conversation
3. curating the work of others into compilations of value

You don't have to be a "creator" to share or boost value. Participating in the public discourse adds a ton of value. It's a form of [Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-supported_collaborative_learning)

# Thoughts!

If this is "collaborative learning" should this not be a "two-way" street whereas at the moment it just appears to me to be showing off and unless you email me I cannot see how this is collaborative!

The reason we should never stop learning is bourn out by [[Digital Garden/The Nun Study\|The Nun Study]]

Unfortunately, [my wife](https://quiditysupport.com/about/) (bless her) would argue it is probably too late for me!!

## Act with Intention

Instead of reacting like a marionette, moving to the whims of the algorithmic puppeteers, consider what it means to **act with intention** in your own life.

We do not need to be helpless to the plots moving and weaving around us. If we only take the time to wake up and pay attention to the weaves, we can see the pattern and begin playing the game instead of having the game play us.

We can act with intention to control the path ahead of us instead of sleep-walking into the future.
