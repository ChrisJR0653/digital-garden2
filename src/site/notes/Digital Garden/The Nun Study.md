Test

Watch this space to see how this develops. I suppose this is more like a blog but it just grows - hence the "garden" analogy.

This is where I will be putting my thoughts and trying to arrange them into some form of coherent order.

See [[Digital Garden/Public learning\|Public learning]] to find out more

All this is written using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and using the excellent templates from [Obsibrain](https://www.obsibrain.com/?aff=5OWvvX) found here

This is all part of the project to make us all more self-sufficient and if you don't like what's going on, you can always vote with your feet.

For me that meant moving part-time to[Thailand](https://quiditysupport.com/design-a-life/). This I hope to move to a more permanent basis in the near future.

I have recently started an online side hussle (working for me anyway!!) and I have been in contact with Greg, the originator of this programme to develop it to help others...

But Greg seems to prefer Notion for his workflows (see a sample template here https://bit.ly/4aqnWoW ) whereas I am an Obsidian "fanboy", so I pulled this up which I think sums up the way my ADHD brain works...

# Why Did I Switch from Obsidian to Notion?

**Final Verdict**

- Notion is for people who want to be very organised in a clean-cut, easily navigate able manner.
- Obsidian is for people who want to explore themselves, who want to be able to map out their thoughts and stumble upon new connections -- note-taking, and maybe content creation.
Which incidentally would appear to fit in with the idea of a "Digital Garden"!

If you can't be bothered (and have a life!) to build your own templates in Obsidian, I can thoroughly recommend [Obsibrain](https://www.obsibrain.com/?aff=5OWvvX)

## Personal Example

An excellent example of what I'm talking about is the ability for Obsidian to portray everything in a graph format.

Not only does this show that thoughts and ideas are very rarely, if ever, in isolation but all part of a greater whole.

This animation of my personal Obsidian vault (my second brain) shows how this grows over time which possibly compensates for the fact that my first brain is degenerating at a similar pace!
