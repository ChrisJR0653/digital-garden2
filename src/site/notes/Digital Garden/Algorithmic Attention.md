The large number of people in the world now get their information & news from a single source: social media.

But social media platforms do not supply this media themselves. Instead, they aggregate content from other providers in the form of screenshots & links (aka posts) that display headlines & hook-optimized formatting to grab your attention.

With millions (maybe billions) of posts created every day, how are these platforms supposed to know what to show you? How do they control the supply?

Answer: Algorithms.

People generate data that is fed to the algorithm. This data is a result of spending attention, both active & inactive. They actively pay attention in a few ways: likes, comments, saves, and shares. However, it's the inactive way that matters more: watch time.

The passive consumption of content on social media platforms is completely tracked. Every single action you do on social media creates data that is fed to the algorithms. The algorithms of each platform take all of this data into account and select what information to feed you each day. Literally - it's called a feed for a reason.

But who do you think controls the algorithms?

Platforms often say it's a black box, or that algorithms are mysterious, or that they don't have direct "control" over the algorithms. While that may be true in a literal sense, in a practical sense, it is not.

What controls the algorithms?Â **The incentives that the platforms establish.**
