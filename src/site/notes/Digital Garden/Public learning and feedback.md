Public learning means sharing information, ideas, and knowledge to the public online, rather than keep them private & offline.

# Thoughts! 26/01/2025

If this is "collaborative learning" should this not be a "two-way" street whereas at the moment it just appears to me to be showing off and unless you email me I cannot see how this is collaborative!

# Or is it just Me???

In my search for a two-way street, I have found this is possible, BUT...

- someone has to log-in (sign) to the hosting provider
- then be "invited" to be part of the "team"
- then install the Chrome browser extension
- then having finished the bottle of whiskey needed to see you through all of this palaver and still got the will to live, leave a comment

## There Must Be an Easier Way!

The downside is how to stop all the comments relating to a long lost uncle in Nigeria who has just passed away, leaving me Â£200m and/or marriage proposals!!

My autistic naivety running riot again!!
